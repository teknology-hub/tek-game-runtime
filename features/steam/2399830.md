# ARK: Survival Ascended

## Features

- When current effective app ID is *not* 2399830, EOS SDK functions are modified to use Epic Games account authorization so online subsystem can initialize successfully. That means you need to have an Epic Games account so you can use it. Dedicated servers seem to timeout connection from such users since version 69.18

## Settings options

|Option|Type|Description|
|-|-|-|
|`force_egs_auth`|Boolean|If `true`, Epic Games authentication will be used even when effective app ID is 2399830|
|`cf_api_wrapper`|String|May specify a domain name that will be used to replace `api.curseforge.com`, so all HTTP requests meant for CurseForge API will go to it. Due to technical limitations, the domain name cannot exceed `api.curseforge.com` in length. Keep in mind that the string in game is actually a format string that prepends a number as a subdomain at runtime. I haven't figured out where that number is taken from yet, but at the moment of writing this the number is 83374, so when you specify `example.com`, it's `83374.example.com` that has to be available. I host `apiw.nuclearist.ru`, that mirrors all requests to `api.curseforge.com` but overrides authentication endpoint so all users are authenticated under the same account, which allows sharing premium mods purchased by any of them|
