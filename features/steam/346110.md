# ARK: Survival Evolved

## Features

- Server search is modified to not include servers with BattlEye, as tek-injector is unable to work with BE-protected processes
- When current effective app ID is 346110, filters are added so servers with DLC maps that are not *actually* owned by current user will not be displayed, *unless* those servers have [TEK Wrapper](https://github.com/Nuclearistt/TEKWrapper)
- When current effective app ID is *not* 346110, a filter is added so only servers that have [TEK Wrapper](https://github.com/Nuclearistt/TEKWrapper) are displayed
- When current effective app ID is *not* 346110, mods will be loaded from path specified by `workshop_dir_path` settings option, i.e. all mods found at that directory will be assumed to be subscribed. Automatic mod downloads when joining modded servers will attempt to use tek-steamclient to perform download

## Settings options

|`show_be_servers`|Boolean|If `true`, servers with enabled BattlEye will be allowed to be displayed|

|`workshop_dir_path`|String|Path to the directory that stores compressed mod files downloaded from Steam Workshop, and where new ones are downloaded to. For users owning the game, Steam uses `steamapps\workshop\content\346110`|
|`workshop_am_path`|String|Path to the game root directory where tek-steamclient application manager instance for downloading mods is initialized.
